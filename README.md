# lights-out
Lights Out consists of an n√ón-grid of cells, each of which can be either on or off.  When the game begins, we specify an initial configuration of on and off cells. Lights Out is a one-player game. Once the cells are configured, the player chooses a cell and turns it on if it is off, and off if it is on.  In response the four neighbouring cells (to the north, south, east, and west) all switch configurations between off and on as well. The object of the game is to get all of the cells turned off.
